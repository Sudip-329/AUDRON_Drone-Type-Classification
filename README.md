# AUDRON: Drone Type Recognition Using Acoustic Signals 🚁🔊

AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network) is a **deep learning framework for drone type recognition using acoustic signals**. The system leverages **fused audio feature representations** to robustly distinguish drone sounds from background noise and classify different drone types, even under challenging real-world conditions.
